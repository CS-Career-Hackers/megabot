# Modchat

Used to anonymously private message bot and information to be relayed to staff team

1. Responds to `++mc`.
2. When private messaged with `++mc <message>`, the message will be forward to a designated channel on the server.
3. Add `-a` flag (so `++mc -a`) to have the message anonymous to staff.
4. Allow mods to designate target channel for messages with `++mc designate` in the target channel.

### Future

5. Add throttling in case people try spam bot.
6. Way to make it two-way communication in case person wants reply and anonymity.
