# Modchat

Allows users to anonymously message or report something to the whole staff team by private messaging the bot.

1. Responds to `++mc`.
2. When private messaged with `++mc <message>`, the message will be forward to a designated channel on the server.
3. `++mc a` anonymizes the message sent to staff.
4. Allow mods to designate target channel for messages by typing `++mc designate` in the target channel.

### Future

5. Add throttling in case people try spam bot.
6. Way to make it two-way communication in case person wants reply and anonymity.
